1.	Actually, I hate pro*titutes.
2.	Pro*titutes occupied 11 characters from 26 characters of English, leaving only 15 left, still a significant 21 per 50 from the compulsory. They believe in character.
3.	Comparatively, a mosquito has more value or melodramatic crashes in sports careers but it is the breeding ground of pro*titutes. Wait, sports can not be a career, as misconceptions end in partial and painful physical damage. Sports is not running for survival 24x7.
4.	The science of it is living dead organisms.
5.	Just think of a random queen criminal; all of them get into a kneeling position in the next microsecond and shout for escape.
6.	They fail in everything.
7.	Only an expert like me destroyed their existence on Earth from a 360-degree perspective; otherwise, it could be a secondary corrupted version of their trial & error failures.
8.	I often drink tea in warmth and witness them in pain. In ground reality, their own group is their enemy; subsequently, they get in an 'acid attack', aware of female-orientated violence.
9.	If the root problem is mosquitoes, I prefer a proper mosquito repellent to any objectionable contradictory partially regulatory social system to erase any feasibility to propagate lies further.
10.	Their bad is starting to finish; they believe in one thing, as existence is 'A to Z', as phases of an evergreen form of mental illness do rely only on science where it's limited to the same 'A to Z' and fears a minimum camera to get recorded of their cancer timeline until dead, constantly jokes in hypocritical terminology to be volatile to personal rotten stories.
11.	In my area I punished them for nothing as hard as they forgot, as a family generation finds medical hospitals before any initiation. Yes, though it sounds funny, finds medical hospitals as per any survival then my own theory of 'A to Z', etc.
12.	Actually I'm the one properly organised there every term so that they get to recognise themselves in dice situations.
13.	This is the proved place dedicated for them to any legislative respective law & order.
