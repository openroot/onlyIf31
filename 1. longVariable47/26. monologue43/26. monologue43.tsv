1.	Actually, I hate pro*titutes.
2.	Pro*titutes occupied 11 characters from 26 characters of English, leaving only 15 left, still a significant 21 per 50 from the compulsory. They believe in character.
3.	Comparatively, a mosquito has more value or melodramatic crashes in sports careers but it is the breeding ground of pro*titutes. Wait, sports can not be a career, as misconceptions end in partial and painful physical damage. Sports is not running for survival 24x7.
4.	The science of it is living dead organisms.
5.	Just think of a random queen criminal; all of them get into a kneeling position in the next microsecond and shout for escape.
6.	They fail in everything.
7.	Only an expert like me destroyed their existence on Earth from a 360-degree perspective; otherwise, it could be a secondary corrupted version of their trial & error failures.
8.	I often drink tea in warmth and witness them in pain. In ground reality, their own group is their enemy; subsequently, they get in an 'acid attack', aware of female-orientated violence.
9.	If the root problem is mosquitoes, I prefer a proper mosquito repellent to any objectionable contradictory partially regulatory social system to erase any feasibility to propagate lies further.
10.	Their bad is starting to finish; they believe in one thing, as existence is 'A to Z', as phases of an evergreen form of mental illness do rely only on science where it's limited to the same 'A to Z' and fears a minimum camera to get recorded of their cancer timeline until dead, constantly jokes in hypocritical terminology to be volatile to personal rotten stories.
11.	In my area I punished them for nothing as hard as they forgot, as a family generation finds medical hospitals before any initiation. Yes, though it sounds funny, finds medical hospitals as per any survival then my own theory of 'A to Z', etc.
12.	Actually I'm the one properly organised there every term so that they get to recognise themselves in dice situations.
13.	This is the proved place dedicated for them to any legislative respective law & order.
14.	It is up to my will if ever I want to swap with a better verse of this monologue and I hold viable resource disputes for interested beneficiaries to get a prototyped resolution.
15.	I'm literate in other languages; this same misperception different order and neither includes anything except that human civilisation is on the brink at this particular time. I'm sorting it in English in the early morning. Hence, I've full authority to target and destroy this business that illegally resided in a crooked mind only.
16.	"Computer" and "nudity" are contradictory, like lots of other contradictory groups of pro*titutes that get ultimate discomfort in this mention, as "computer" took over every feasible factor of the world for today & the future. So, pro*titutes are completely rebellious, being frustrated as they are completely insecure today due to the invention of computers. As a finding on the computer & internet, they're mostly committing suicide.
17.	Lots of pro*titutes have completed their lifecycle on Earth and are dead already and will be unable to find this saddening magazine.
18.	"Playboy" is one of the recent popular merchandise that will fail thoroughly. I'm never against if they just called it phonetically "sex worker" but against money it is "p*rnography", which has a direct connection to pro*titutes who might be uncomfortable here at getting targeted as criminal bench. Better they shut down any such asset or face a level of such life-threatening losses. I represent my personal choice as counter merchandise, "WikiLeaks", to let them engage on their own to minimise the use of any exported property.
19.	So mentioning their complete case as it would be in every term, "WikiLeaks" versus "Playboy", as a permanent enemy of type, just to get murdered, probably as primarily signified in physical registrations. I declare in my life I was never associated with any scandal from any kind of pro*titute platform or they mostly recognised, ranging it as like "sex racket", "sex traffic", "sex network", "escort service", "online pro*titution", "illegal marital affair" and "mistress mansion" and not aware of any existence of these types of systems.
20.	Let me think of a specification from their point of view; I am some kind of respectful species at a superb derogatory useless dawdler. Their lame objective against me arose from limited digital literacy.
