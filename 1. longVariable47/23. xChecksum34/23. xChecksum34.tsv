..	It's never a question of choice but what's getting decided amongst the seven. How many wonders are there in the world? Though civilisation denies incarnation, it's intelligent enough to make one of wonder, pyramid.
1.	The general perception is that the top of everything is empty & non-beneficial. What is the highest convenience in the world? A cellular network produces the highest benefit due to emptiness at the top.
2.	Dinosaurs were never extinct from Earth; perhaps recently they moulded themselves into reptiles. Why did modern discoveries fail to prove it? The basic theoretical evolution seeks to accumulate features, in this case, moving vertically.
3.	The artificial birthing process has been only permitted in human civilisation for Caesarean. Is surgery ethical for this inhabitable organic need? Actually, respective governments must have equipped the first-class problem, e.g., periodic ultrasound scans.
4.	Human civilisation on any exoplanet other than Earth is not possible at all. Can I sail on a spaceship to colonise? Come to minimum logic because you're proposing another planetary body but not celestial.
5.	As a matter of fact, animals have set a beauty standard on Earth. Are humans trying to steal the beauty standard? It's partially correct due to the obvious reason that the kingdom has proprietorship.
6.	It was never a question of resourcefulness of the most important commodity production. What could be the top puzzle beyond time? It was always about the stretch; the best consumable electricity had been established.
7.	I propose a communicator channel to accommodate the mosaic format for my next. Do we run on suggestions that come first? Every birth that happens after the context of that the real thing exists.
8.	The new transportation is the one parallel device that switches trains and computers. What redefines futuristic measurements in the universe today? It's jumbo mechanics that fuel any imaginable number of workloads from the population.
9.	As infinity does not exist, zero isn't the exact opposite of ideal infinity. What is the biggest blunder in human history? Alike, good versus evil went wrong to defy a symbol but behaved zero.
10.	There is a brand-new breed that has reached this world known as battery. Is the globe suddenly facing tremendous weather events? An alien stateless object battery that was reported to the present universal time.

17.	The so-called model is an "empty situation" regarding rules and regulations about childbirth. What is this corrupted model on the ground? The wholesome nonsense advocates freedom at willingness but lacks it at every marriage.
18.	Add a tag-line to your product from initial to secure a valid licence. Do you know what the biggest community is? It's anything which has an appropriate licence up to your limit of production.
19.	The foremost condition a train is equipped with is to change its name. Who's going to stay but fails to sustain? Recognise a few things for this example are defaulted into for performance durability.
20.	Indian citizens have the strange ethics to attach culture with a regular course. Are there a minimum of three probes mandatory? At the manufacturing hub, electrification is a must and goes through three factors.
21.	Choke-slam is the last recognised martial art that can destroy any imaginary economy. What extension could be the most extreme joke? Before any feasible imagination comes, it destroys any form of targeted ill intention.
22.	The fun of life is in the unknown things, which are complexity levels. Are things meant to be known forever, always? None of the elements from the start of creation are known to anyone.
23.	You reached a temperature to melt glassy elements, which is equivalent to stars. Are you interested in doing a curious business? After that, you need to swap as quickly as possible to enjoy nuclear.
24.	When water gets cooled into a freezing temperature, it converts into floating ice. Why does it reject the theory of gravitation? Because the ice contains hot water blocks inside and physical hotness moves upwards.
25.	Each & every dandruff particle is probably an alert for the cancer disease. Who said life is easy in this place? Using shampoo not only lowers the cancer risk but also brings positive benefits.
26.	Everything tells its story itself unless you're trying to waste time reading this. So is it a waste to read this? Definitely it's not a waste because the sentence's intention and the reader differ.
::.	The boring part of it is that it never lets you get diseased. Did you think being patient was a choice? Then start rethinking for yourself from when you were aware of the disease.
